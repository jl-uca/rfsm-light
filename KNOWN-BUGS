Known bugs and limitations

* multi-FSM models are not supported (use RFSM if required)

* Multi-events FSM models are not supported by the VHDL backend

* Synchronous interpretation of actions is not (yet) supported by the CTask and SystemC backends

* The concept of transition priority used in RFSM is not supported; as a result, simulation may fail due to
  non-deterministic situations.

* A portable way of building on Linux distros is still missing

* The font selection dialog does not work on MacOS 10.9 (this seems to be a bug in Qt < 5.12)

* Due to the syntax of the RFSM language
  - the name of FSM inputs, outputs and local variables must start with a lowercase letter,
  - the name of states must start with an uppercase letter

* One added an input, output or variable description (name and type) cannot be edited.  The
workaround is to delete (button `remove`) the item and re-enter it with the new specification.
Stimuli attached to inputs can be edited, though, by selecting the corresponding item and clicking
the `Stimuli` button.
