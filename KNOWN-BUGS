Known bugs and limitations

* the drawing canvas can quickly become too small : enlarge it or allow it to be resized

* multi-FSM models are not supported (use RFSM if required)

* Multi-events FSM models are not supported by the VHDL backend

* Synchronous interpretation of actions is not (yet) supported by the CTask and SystemC backends

* The concept of transition priority used in RFSM is not supported; as a result, simulation may fail due to
  non-deterministic situations.

* A portable way of building on Linux distros is still missing

* The font selection dialog does not work on MacOS 10.9 (this seems to be a bug in Qt < 5.12)

* Due to the syntax of the RFSM language, the name of FSM inputs, outputs and local variables
  _must_ start with a lowercase identifier.
