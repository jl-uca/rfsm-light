Known bugs and limitations

* Multi-events and multi-FSM models are not supported by the VHDL backend

* There's no bound check for values with a ranged-integer type

* Synchronous interpretation of actions is not (yet) supported by the CTask and SystemC backends

* The implementation of cascaded event synchronisation in SystemC using delta-cycles is fragile

* The concept of transition priority used in RFSM is not supported; as a result, simulation may fail due to
  non-deterministic situations.

* A portable way of building on Linux distros is still missing

* The font selection dialog does not work on MacOS 10.9 (this seems to be a bug in Qt < 5.12)

* Due to the syntax of the RFSM language, the name of FSM inputs, outputs and local variables
  _must_ start with a lowercase identifier.
