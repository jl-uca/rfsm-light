* DIST
- a small video on youtube showing how to create, draw, simulate and compile a small FSD
- update windows install guide (currently simply copied from Rfsm)

* GUI
- Support for saving and reading .opts file
- Less-minimalistic About dialog
- Populate examples dir 
- VHDL and SystemC syntax highlighters
- Use Dot widget instead of translating to gif via external command (links in etc/doc)
- Export to SCXML ?
- Allow attachement of priorities to transitions
- Dedicated input fields for stimuli instead of raw text field ?
- Re-implement IO handling with a List (or Table) ModelView ?
- When reading from file, do not erase existing model before file reading completed successfully
- Allow resizing of state boxes
- Change cursor shape according to currently selected tool
- Draw state boxes with round corners
- Add properties (labels) to states ?

* COMPILER

- rewrite menhir parser with $sloc+%inline (cf OCaml 4.08 srcs)
- support for synchronous actions in CTask and SystemC
- bound check for ranged integers
- check for coherency in reaction responses (see src/lib/simul.ml)
- var and output attr on states (Moore-style)
- clarify mechanism for delta-waits insertion in SystemC backend
- VHDL implementation of models with multiple input events
- VHDL implementation of event and variable synchronized models
- FreeRTOS (or other RTOS) specialized C-backend
- SCXML backend (www.w3.org/TR/scxml, Yakindu, ...)
- SMV backend (with predicated states for connection to model-checking tools)
- foreign function interfacing

BUILD
- ocamlbuild -> dune ?
- use cmake for building GUI ?
